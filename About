ABSTRACT :
• To recover the occluded object information from satellite images, shadow removal is a significant processing
procedure for the image interpretation and application.
• So a novel framework of shadow detection and removal for panchromatic satellite images to restore the
obscured object information is developed.
• The proposed algorithm is based on hard shadow detection by local thresholding methods and trained a
convolutional neural network framework for salient feature extraction.
• Shadow removal is performed by Gamma correction, histogram mismatching and IOOPL based loop
matching.
• A comparative study between these process are also conducted and is evaluated into two modes such as
objective evaluation on the basis of SSIM and PSNR and subjective evaluation on the basis of gray value
profile recovery.
• This comprehensive approach aims to achieve superior object information restoration in satellite images by
combining the strengths of CNNs and traditional image processing methods.
